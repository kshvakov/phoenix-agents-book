The appendices are **templates and reference artifacts** that complement the chapters. They help you make decisions reviewable and verifiable without false precision.

- [Appendix A: business case](A-business-case.md): variables, risks, go/no-go criteria—no promises and no magic multipliers.
- [Appendix B: organizational transformation](B-organizational-transformation.md): how to roll out the practice without resistance and without marketing fluff.
- [Appendix C: process and artifacts](C-process-and-artifacts.md): the end-to-end process map and the minimal sufficient set of artifacts.
- [Glossary](glossary.md): shared definitions and naming rules.
